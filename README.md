<h3 align="left">Hello there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="25px" height="25px"></h3>

My name is Miguel, and I'm a software engineer with a passion for helping people.

🌎 **Location**

NYC

🏹 **What I'm looking for**

I always have my eye out on opportunities that will continue advancing my career! Currently [Unqork](https://unqork.com) and building [Databridge](https://databridge-cms.com). 

👀 **I am especially interested in**

- **Back-End** roles that focus on building and maintaining data-intensive applications, leveraging my skills in designing scalable and high-performance enterprise systems
- **Full-Stack** roles that allow me to build beautiful client facing applications and robust features on the server

However, what's most important to me is working with a great team. I thrive in a culture of regular sync collaboration with teammates, a commitment to active code review, honest feedback loops, and having a high degree of autonomy in my work.

💻 **A quick story about me**

I made a career transition from sales to software engineering in 2021, and I have since gained valuable experience in both front-end and back-end development. In my first role as a software engineer, I primarily focused on front-end development, leveraging tools such as React, Styled Components, Material UI, and API clients to fetch and manipulate data. One of my most impressive projects at this startup was iterating on an admin tool that streamlined the deployment of resources to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) via an admin portal, reducing the time it took to onboard or modify user accounts.

During the summer of 2022, I worked as a full-stack developer at a non-profit organization that aimed to help formerly incarcerated individuals learn the skills necessary to have a successful future in the tech industry. In this role, I primarily focused on maintaining and building back-end applications.

I am dedicated to continuous learning and keeping my skills sharp and up to date. I enjoy exploring new technologies and building useful side projects to stay current with industry trends.
